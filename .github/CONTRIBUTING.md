Contributions are always welcome, including problem reports,
feature requests, bug fixes, feature implementations, documentation
corrections or improvements, and any other constructive contributions.

If you want to add a substantial new feature:
* Consider opening a feature-request issue to discuss the proposed change first.
* Tests and documentation will be needed before any PR can be merged.
  (But a partial/work-in-progress PR is still welcome.)
* If you would like help implementing tests or docs, be sure to check 
  "[allow edits from maintainers][maintainer-edits]" when opening your PR.
